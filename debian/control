Description: Conservative garbage collector for C (development)
 Boehm's GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is
 intended to be used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc.
 This package is required to compile and link programs that use
 libgc1.
 .
 Since the collector does not require pointers to be tagged, it does
 not attempt to ensure that all inaccessible storage is reclaimed.
 However it has typically been more successful at reclaiming unused
 memory than most C programs using explicit deallocation.  Unlike
 manually introduced leaks, the amount of unreclaimed memory typically
 stays bounded.
